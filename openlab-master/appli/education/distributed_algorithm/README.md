Distributed algorithms
======================

Practical work for course 'Distributed Algorithms and Network Systems' from
MiSCIT Master - Grenoble - Fall 2014.

Prepared by Federica Garin and GaÃ«tan Harter

Goal
----

Cooperative algorithms using radio communicating nodes:

+ Average consensus: all nodes compute the average of some values, where
  initially each value is known by a single node
    - Syncronous communication
    - 'Gossip' mode communication
+ Estimate the number of nodes
