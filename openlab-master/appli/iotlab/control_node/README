    control_node is current working version
        The main feature here is asynchronous reception/transmission and a layered code architecture.

    controlnode_clement version developped by HiKoB Clement with layered code architecture and async serial
    control_node_fabien_old old version developped by fabien, temporary kept for backup.

It depends on autotest_common
